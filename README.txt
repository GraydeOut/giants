What does this program do?
**************************
This program simulates several cashier lines as queues. By adjusting the amount of customers, whether
they are full/self service and their arrival/service times you can attempt to find a balance between
customer satisfaction and line efficiency.  

Note:
*****
Due to current limitations the simulation will only allow one customer to arrive per minute.

Instructions:
*************
To run this project start from the Main class. Follow prompts in the console to enter time ranges for 
arrival and service durations. Next you must enter how much longer self service takes as a percentage.
Then enter the number of customers to be simulated. It is best to limit this number to 700 or less 
otherwise you will not see all statistics for each customer. Note that any time and customers must be 
greater than zero. After providing the initial conditions the program will simulate the queues and then 
output to console some statistics.

A fairly efficient set of values is Arrival 1-3, Service 2-7, Self Service Modifier 30%, 500 customers
